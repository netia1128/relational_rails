# Project:Relational_Rails

### Group Member Names:
#### Netia Ingram & Mark Yen

**Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):**  
Mark: To learn from my partner!
Netia: To get practice standing a rails app from scratch and how to collaboratively build a project.

**Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):**  
Mark is very flexible. He tries to learn a problem on his own, but will ask questions if he runs into a wall. Mark is easygoing, if it is a basic question, no judgment here.
Netia's best strength for this project is her lack of shame, which means she has no hesitation in asking for help or advice. Netia likes working with people and making something awesome as a team effort, and enjoys human beings!

**How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:**  
We feel like our strengths mesh very well together. We both will ask questions when we run into an issue.  

**Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):**  
We stand up database together and have daily checkins. Always open to ask questions with each other and other cohort mates. 
4:30p stand up for 30min.

**Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):**  
We will communicate via slack for messaging or tuple for paired programming as often as needed. We both like brainstorming to arrive at decisions. We will talk through any issues that arise, including any related to emotional or mental well-being.

**Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):**  
Get a good grasp of rails and databases. Through this project we would like to learn from scratch and build upon that.

**Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):**  
We can work on our own for this one.

**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):**   
- We can create branches for this one.
- Approve other's pull request.
- Commit properly.

**Pomodoro Break Schedule:**  
Maybe take a small break, but not necessary.

**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:**  
Mark always tries to be kind and polite when giving feedback. He likes any feedback he received to be constructive.
Netia is sometimes unintentionally blunt when giving feedback, but will try very hard to be cognizant of how what she is saying comes across rather than focusing on the intent. Netia like lots of feedback and doesn't care how it's given.

### Additional Remote Considerations:

**Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):**  
Github

**Day 1 Agenda:**  
Complete DTR and start coding.
